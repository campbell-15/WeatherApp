## Tech Stack

Web API | Javascript | React.js | HTML5 & CSS | Bootstrap

 ## Features

 OpenWeatherMap API | Search Functionality | React.js Components

## Process

This project was planned out through learning more about API's.
Using the OpenWeatherMap API I was about to search for the weather for each city and display it respectively.
Using react hooks I was about able to reference the state and history of the application to display more details about the weather

## Improvements

I would love to hear feedback.
I would like to add functionality in the future where I can display graphs of past and future weather updates.
